Basics of React (useState, props, useEffect)
[

    - useState : Used to manage local component state. like count functionallity 
    - props : Used to pass data from parent to child component.
    - useEffect : Runs side-effects like API calls or logging
]


Set up a store with configureStore
[
    install dependenci : npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
    Why?
    To keep all your app's global data in one place, instead of passing props deeply.

    üßæ Example:

    Shopping cart data

    Logged-in user info

    App theme (light/dark)

    üõ†Ô∏è It's like: A school notice board ‚Äî every classroom (component) can read/write to it.
